# expense_reclassification
This reclassification engine is a powerful tool to classify transactions into their actual categories. I have stress tested this for over a million lines, without exception. Due to the modular nature of the code and libraries used, this can be applied to pretty much any transaction-level file such as GL dumps, bank statements etc.
